  Circle K Lawsuit problems

Circle K does not have a fair sign on the front of their stores indicating a specific fair time limit (under corporate or small to mid size business law regarding treating every potential customer "fairly")





		
	IF YOU HAVE BEEN HARASSED BY CIRCLE K YOU MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR A LAWSUIT WITH CIRCLE K GAS STATION STORE

  ========================================================================

	Circle K doesn't have a current fair time limit on their sign in front of the store

so Circle K attendants are violating potential customers out of the attendants own bias

Circle K attendants sometimes let guests stay on the property for over an hour or two

but other guests are forced to leave in less than 15 minutes sometimes out of the active attendants bias towards the person


not only this but Circle K is harassing people with the police when its operating with unfair corporate business practices "BY NOT DECLARING A FAIR TIME LIMIT FOR A GUEST TO IDLE ON THE PROPERTY"
WHICH WOULD GIVE EVERY POTENTIAL CUSTOMER A FAIR CHANCE TO GET THEIR BEARINGS WHEN VISITING CIRCLE K WHETHER THE GUEST HAS PHYSICAL DISABILITIES OR NOT


as an example THIS WOULD BE A FAIR SIGN BECAUSE IT HAS A TIME LIMIT

"guests of Circle K that are in front of the store or on the property for more than 30 minutes will be considered trespassing and will be asked to leave by the current attendant not to return for a minimum of 3 hours"

BUT CIRCLE K DOES NOT DECLARE ANY FAIR TIME LIMIT UNTIL SOMEONE IS CONSIDERED POTENTIALLY TRESPASSING (LOITERING)  ON THE PROPERTY
